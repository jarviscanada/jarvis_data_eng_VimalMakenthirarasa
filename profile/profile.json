      "description": "Conducted an in-depth evaluation of four Classification and Regression Tree (CART) regression algorithms—Decision Tree Learner, Random Tree Learner, Bootstrap Aggregating Learner (Bag Learner), and Insane Learner—through the design and execution of three targeted experiments using stock data for multiple worldwide indexes. Analyzed the effects of leaf size on overfitting, assessed the efficacy of bagging in mitigating overfitting, and compared decision trees with random trees using innovative performance metrics. Utilized Python, along with Matplotlib and NumPy, to implement the algorithms, perform data analysis, and visualize results. Delivered actionable insights to enhance model generalizability and optimize predictive performance, demonstrating strong proficiency in machine learning techniques and data visualization.",
