# Vimal Makenthirarasa . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from the University of Western Ontario, and a current part-time Masters student at the Georgia Institute of Technology (remote), working towards a Masters degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. My academic experience has provided me with an extensive understanding of programming and proper software development practices, including writing clean code and efficiently debugging issues to provide high quality software solutions to suit clients’ needs. In terms of professional experience, I have worked as a Web Developer for the University of Western Ontario, working on real-time management of a dynamic website, ensuring up to date information delivery and a seamless user experience. I also worked as a Software Developer for LingoThyme Inc., an EdTech startup company created to help users learn languages in a collaborative environment. During my time at LingoThyme Inc., I played a pivotal role in building the company’s full-stack collaborative learning platform and developed several features including the implementation of live data synchronization between users with optimized socket functionality and the creation of multiple custom responsive web pages to deliver a satisfying user experience. I am personally driven by the potential to create impactful applications that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences for many people, and I am excited to contribute to an innovative team where I can continue to expand my skills and make a meaningful difference.

**Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VimalMakenthirarasa/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VimalMakenthirarasa/tree/main/linux_sql)]: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Linux cluster monitoring agent to gather and monitor hardware specifications and real-time resource usage of a Linux cluster. Created Bash scripts to automate processes for creating, starting, and stopping the Docker container used for the PostgreSQL instance, as well as to automate creation of PostgreSQL database tables. Populated database tables with hardware specifications and resource usage data using Linux commands. Automated gathering of hardware specifications and resource usage data by using Crontab to schedule running the data collection scripts every 60 seconds and updating the database accordingly.


## Highlighted Projects
**Stock Analyzer using CART Regression**: Conducted an in-depth evaluation of four Classification and Regression Tree (CART) regression algorithms—Decision Tree Learner, Random Tree Learner, Bootstrap Aggregating Learner (Bag Learner), and Insane Learner—through the design and execution of three targeted experiments using stock data for multiple worldwide indexes. Analyzed the effects of leaf size on overfitting, assessed the efficacy of bagging in mitigating overfitting, and compared decision trees with random trees using innovative performance metrics. Utilized Python, along with Matplotlib and NumPy, to implement the algorithms, perform data analysis, and visualize results. Delivered actionable insights to enhance model generalizability and optimize predictive performance, demonstrating strong proficiency in machine learning techniques and data visualization.

**Facial Recognition Based Home Security System**: Developed a robust home security system leveraging C++ and OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi platform. Integrated advanced functionalities including facial recognition, object detection, and real-time image processing to monitor live camera feeds effectively. Implemented a Haar Cascade classifier to accurately identify known faces, achieving a 91% accuracy rate, thereby ensuring reliable security monitoring and enhancing user confidence in system performance. Demonstrated expertise in computer vision, embedded systems, and real-time data processing to deliver a scalable and efficient security solution.
